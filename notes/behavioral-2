Rapport:
-   Goal
    -   Increase impression of yourself, spark a sense of trust & connection ****
    -   To show interviewer you think alike
    -   To prove you can get the job done
    -   Be concise, succinct, & focused in your talking and ideas that are communicated
        & do not swich/movearound bc it'll confuse the listener. Do not stutter & pause
        bc it shows low confidence & you don't know what you're saying respectively

-   Tips:
    -   Dress and groom well
    -   Mirroring (where possible)
    -   Echo your interviewer's responses to show you're listening
    -   Repeat some of their comments back to them, and show you approve of what they say
    -   Show enthusiasm. Cannot stress this one enough
        -   It is often the ones that show most enthusiasm that get the role

-   Questions:
    -   How has your week/weekend been going/go? How is your day going?

Personality:
-   Driven & Hungry (forai & finance)
-   Task-oriented person (do not like wasting time)
    -   Self-starting attitude
    -   Can build from scratch 
    -   Comfortable with the unknown
-   Ownership
    -   I focus on being the person that takes care of a problem and figures it out
-   Calculative risk taking 
    -   Esp considering limitied resources like time, research, & money
-   Goal-oriented
-   Collaborative
    -   More together
    -   Teach others
-   Outspoken & supportive documents
-   Open & not sensitive to constructive feedback


Improvements:
-   Very collaborative before working & with mid/easy level tasks 
    -   With very deep tasks I become consumed by work
-   Sometimes I do not know the correct decision and often being the lead I don't have access 
    to someone with more knowledge so I go with the decision I think is best  & sometimes it doesn't work out 
    -   But I always learn & look back to why it didn't work
-   I was not strong in stress testing 
-   I was not strong in data normalizating
-   I was not strong in event driven architectures
-   Sometimes I overaanalyze how a solution should be made bc I do not want to introduce too much complexity,
    more particularly with REALLY big tasks,
    however I am constantly trying to take smaller risks that can be reversed rather than overinvesting in study 
    and not getting any feedback from the actual experimentation I am doing
    (This happens all the time when I am reseraching new technologies to fix old bad practices I felt I had - statemanagemnt
    and doing finance research on jupyter)
-   Weakness in personal life:
    I tend to find gravitate towards high independence & managing all my actions and outcomes to be based solely
    on how I executed the plan. Sometimes it is very hard to find a good team, however I am compensating for this 
    by constantly trying to increase my patience AND my relationship building.
-   Managing expectations
    Esp when boss overpromises & hangs around in poker planning and oversells simplicity of tasks 
    Sometimes leads to underdelivering & missing deadlines
    We don't get full documentation & features from boss
