Questions:
-   How will end users use the product?
-   What is the problem we are trying to solve
    and how do we deliver the most value in the
    way that decreases customer experience the 
    least??

-   How do I get the data to build out the 
    best features?


System Design Questions:
-   Ask what main features are so we know 
    what may need to scale and what may need 
    to be flexible for change later
-   Make it scalable 
-   Simple and easy to use 
-   Design data models 
-   Ask questions, edge cases, & optimization
