&

Colocate logical steps in algorithm 
    to make more sense of it
    esp. in nested structures



Pros:
-   Committers are more motivated to push better code 
-   Sharing Knowledge (Application or engineering type knowledge)
-   Consistency (Maintains same standard between devs)
-   Legibility (more reusable, bug-free, and future proof)
-   Accidental error
-   Complaiancce


Before Code Review:
-   Modulize commits to specific tasks (so as to not combine tasks in a single code review & confuse reviewer)
-   Add description of what goals of the changes are




What I look for:
-   Elegant and simple code 
-   It should have some sort of test
-   It should be readable, maintainable, and production quality
-   It should have a readme file with instructions for the ease of review 
-   Better commites (for code releases)

test('object assignment', () => {
    expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
    expect(data).toEqual({one: 1, two: 2});
}
