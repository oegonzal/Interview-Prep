Event-loop

Single-threaded concurrency model of nodejs
-   Based on nonblocking IO operations

Typically a system consists of many events:
-   Keyboard
-   Mouse
-   Requests


Node
-   Uses event base model 
-   Takes requests and puts into single threaded event queue
-   Event loop runs indefinitely
    -   If it takes a nonblocking request it will process it and prepare a response
    -   If is blocking it will delegate it to a worker thread and thread pool to 
        work on the blocking io operation. 
        The blocking IO operation may be associated with a callback function. When the 
        blocking operation is complete it'll prepare the response back to the queue & 
        it'll be finished there and then it'll send it back to client 


Threaded server
Keep in mind that in a threaded server the programmer has to keep track and account for 
synchronization of state between different threads in a process. This tends to be harder than
working with an event-loop server
