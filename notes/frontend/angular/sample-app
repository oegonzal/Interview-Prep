Angular:
-   Has typescript decorators




List:
-   Use CLI to create eCommerce app




Typescript: 
    Decorator:
    -   https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html
    -   Provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax 
        for class declarations and members
    -   Can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter. 

    -   As such, the following steps are performed when evaluating multiple decorators 
        on a single declaration in TypeScript:

        1. The expressions for each decorator are evaluated top-to-bottom.
        2. The results are then called as functions from bottom-to-top.


    function f() {
        console.log("f(): evaluated");

        return function (
            target,
            propertyKey: string,
            descriptor: PropertyDescriptor
        ) {
            console.log("f(): called");
        };
    }

    function g() {
        console.log("g(): evaluated");

        return function (
            target,
            propertyKey: string,
            descriptor: PropertyDescriptor
        ) {
            console.log("g(): called");
        };
    }

    class C {
        @f()
        @g()
        method() {}
    }

    Prints:
        f(): evaluated
        g(): evaluated
        g(): called
        f(): called
