Here we can only take 1 or 2 coins. 2 players are playing. The coins are in a line.
The player who in the end has the most value in coins after both players have finished the line of coins
wins.

Return if the first player can force a win.

How do we determine the outcome?
DP problem

You have to consider all possible situations. 
How do we store the best of all these situations each time we iterate and make the problem more complex?

P1

vs

P2

Will need 2 arrays, one keeps track of whether P1 wins or loses.
Other array will track the total value of the spots that player 1 can get

OR

we can add the highest possible sum P1 can get and then subtract that with the total sum of the coins. If the sum is majority
P1 wins.
