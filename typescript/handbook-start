JavaScript has grown to be a language of choice for both frontend and backend applications of every size. 
While the size, scope, and complexity of programs written in JavaScript has grown exponentially, the ability 
of the JavaScript language to express the relationships between different units of code has not.


Combined with JavaScriptâ€™s rather peculiar runtime semantics, this mismatch between language and program 
complexity has made JavaScript development a difficult task to manage at scale.


The most common kinds of errors that programmers write can be described as type errors: 
    a certain kind of value was used where a different kind of value was expected.









A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:

    Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns
    Explain the effects of important compiler options
    Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases
    Write a .d.ts declaration for a simple function, object, or class
