Important Concepts

- Tiny urls can be used for
    - Track individual links to anaylze audience
    - Measure ad campaigns' performance
    - hide affiliated original URLs

- 80 / 20 rule
    - 20 percent of the objects generate 80 percent  of the work (traffic)
    - Helps w/ knowing what to cache

- Api_dev_keys can help limit request usage to prevent malicious users
    and to be able to throttle users based on api allocated quota

- Unique hasg for url
    - MD5
    - SHA256

- Encoding can be base 36 ([a-z,0-9]) or base62([A-z,a-z,0-9])
    or base 64 if also incluses + and /

- If we use the MD5 algorithm as our hash function, 
    it will produce a 128-bit hash  value
- After base64 encoding, weâ€™ll get a string having more than 21 characters (since each base64 character encodes 6 bits of the hash value). Now we only have space for 6 (or 8) characters per short key
