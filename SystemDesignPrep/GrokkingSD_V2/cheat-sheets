Prep:
- Just keep designing & reviewing different systems
- Leetcode little by little
- Rest on Work + Finding patterns/setups in Market + premiums/insurances


Stories to focus:
- ICS data collection & analytics (aggregation services + tracking links)
- TS booking locking management + oAuth integrations
- Webhooks
- Framework caching performance, white-label customization algo, & containerization


Otherwise:
- 100% focus on LinkedIn replies & setting up calls w/ correct companies
- Based on company: React, Python, Angular, AWS
- Remote, mid-large comp, autonomy, manager, & team not super collaborative


PLAN:
- Note down main terms
- Foreach system --> note down main services & foreach service --> note-down main components it interacts with
- watch vids before sleeping
