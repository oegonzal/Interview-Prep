DOs
1. Ask questions about the scope, (only 40 min) need to narrow constrains to have focus
2. Back of the envelope estimations (will determine flexibility & direction of design)
3. Define what APIs are expected from the system
4. Define the data models ---> will guide later for data partioning & modeling
5. High level design
6. Detailed design --> present different approaches while discussing tradeoffs
7. Identifying bottlenecks






Strategies:
- Do we have replicas to avoid single point of failure (fault tolerance --> like zone failure & redirection)
- Monitoring to get an idea over time of what needs to scale
