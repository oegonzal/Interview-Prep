What is Youtube?
- Popular Video Streaming Service

Functional requirements#
We require that our system is able to perform the following functions:

- Stream videos
- Upload videos
- Search videos according to titles
- Like and dislike videos
- Add comments to videos
- View thumbnails


Non-functional requirements
It’s important that our system also meets the following requirements:

- High availability: The system should be highly available. High availability requires a good percentage of uptime. Generally, an uptime of 99% and above is considered good.
- Scalability: As the number of users grows, these issues should not become bottlenecks: storage for uploading content, the bandwidth required for simultaneous viewing, and the number of concurrent user requests should not overwhelm our application/web server.
- Good performance: A smooth streaming experience leads to better performance overall.
- Reliability: Content uploaded to the system should not be lost or damaged.

- We don’t require strong consistency for YouTube’s design. Consider an example where a creator uploads a video. Not all users subscribed to the creator’s channel should immediately get the notification for uploaded content.

- To summarize, the functional requirements are the features and functionalities that the user will get, whereas the non-functional requirements are the expectations in terms of performance from the system.
